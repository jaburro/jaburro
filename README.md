- 👋 Hi, I’m James
- 👀 I’m interested in of course I.T. stuff, but photography, digital art, and caffeine!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Java, just started Javascript, and hopefully will start C++ soon. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on professional processes.  I'm not sure if I am the only one but I kind of just draw up a UI then throw code at it. I'm pretty sure doing it wrong. 
- 📫 How to reach me
